## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Programming-Hero-Web-Course4/b11a12-client-side-Bijoydas2
git clone https://github.com/Programming-Hero-Web-Course4/b11a12-server-side-Bijoydas2
```

### 2. Frontend setup

```bash
cd b11a12-client-side-Bijoydas2
npm install
# create .env.local with required Firebase, API base URL and Stripe keys
npm run build # or npm start for dev
```

### 3. Backend setup

```bash
cd b11a12-server-side-Bijoydas2
npm install
# create .env with MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT (if used), STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
npm run start:dev
```

### 4. Environment variables (example keys to add)

* `MONGODB_URI` â€” MongoDB connection string
* `JWT_SECRET` â€” secret used for signing JWTs
* `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc. â€” Firebase config for the frontend
* `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` â€” (optional) service account credentials for server-side Firebase operations
* `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` â€” server-side Stripe secret key
* `CLIENT_ORIGIN` â€” allowed frontend origin for CORS

---

## Notes & Recommendations

* Use **HttpOnly cookies** for JWTs to protect against XSS.
* For production, rotate demo credentials and set secure cookie flags (`Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` where appropriate).
* Restrict CORS origins on the server to production domains only.
* Use strong validation and rate limiting on public endpoints (e.g. login, application submission).
* Back up MongoDB and configure proper indexes for analytics queries.
